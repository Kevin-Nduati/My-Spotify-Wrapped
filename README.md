# My-Spotify-Wrapped
The project aimed to create a personalized version of Spotify Wrapped, which summarizes a user's listening history for the year. The project used airflow for orchestration, Docker for containerization, dbt for modeling and transforming data, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery. The goal was to extract the user's listening history data from Spotify's API, transform it, and load it into a database. The transformed data would then be used to generate personalized insights and visualizations summarizing the user's listening history. The project aimed to provide a fun and engaging way for users to reflect on their musical tastes and preferences over time.
